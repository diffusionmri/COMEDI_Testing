COMEDI (Computational Medical Imaging Toolkit) is a free library for mainly computational neuroimaging, includes structural MRI, diffusion MRI, etc. It is developed mainly in MATLAB, also written in Python and Shell into part codes. It does this by taking a fully modular object-oriented technology. Using COMEDI you can design, fit, track, analysis, visualize, and recover the parameters of some diffusion model is usually simply using command-line. These methods are designed for general acquisition schemes, which usually can be used directly with no additional toolbox needed. With the COMEDI, you can also easier to develop with less technical limitations a new algorithm. Moreover, COMEDI implements a complete pipeline from pre-processing to post-processing then analysis results, most of the algorithms generalize the state-of-the-art technology to achieve robust analysis with fewer assumptions. This relies on that COMEDI also provides a powerful I/O interface to support most of the medical image format. In addition to its own function, COMEDI also provides a powerful API interface to allow users to directly call third-party software (e.g. FSL, MRtrix3, Freesurfer, Dipy, and Camino) within COMEDI. A user-interface being developed to allow the COMEDI one-click use. Nevertheless, COMEDI is for research only, please do not use results from COMEDI for clinical decisions. In total, COMEDI aims to construct a free, open-source, and cross-platform one-stop project for computational neuroimaging.
